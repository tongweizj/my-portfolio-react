## TAsk

### **Home Page** 
1. welcome message
2. link or button that allows the user to redirect to your About Me Page and / or other pages. 
3. **Mission Statement.**

### **About Me Page**
1. legal name
2. an image of you (I recommend a head and shoulders shot), 
3. a short paragraph about who you are. 
4. Keep this clean and simple as it may be viewed by perspective employers.
5. Resume
Your **About Me page** should include a link to a PDF version of your Resume.

### **Projects Page** 
at least 3 Projects 
- Include an image for each Project 
- a short description of your role and the outcome.

### **Services Page** 
- a short list of services you offer
 (e.g. general programming, web development, mobile apps, etc.).
- I recommend including images that make this more appealing to view.

### **Contact Page**
- contact information in a panel or other construct.
- a short interactive form 
  that allows the user send you a message 
  and provide basic contact information (First Name, Last Name, Contact Number, Email Address, Message, etc.). 
  This form does not have to be fully functional initially. 
  However, it should be able to capture the information entered by the user and redirect them back to the Home Page.
